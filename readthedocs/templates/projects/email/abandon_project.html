  <p>
    We've had a request from one of our users for the project name {{ proj_name }} on Read the Docs. You are the current owner, and we wanted to reach out to you in accordance with our Abandoned Project policy (<a href="http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abandoned-projects.html">http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abandoned-projects.html</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Since this is a fork of the existing owners project, {{ proj_name }}, you must show us the additional work that has been done in order to keep the new project name, that is different than the existing version of the project.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please reply to this email either allowing or disallowing the transfer of the name on Read the Docs within 6 weeks, otherwise we will take the action of *initiating the transfer to a new owner* by default.
  </p>
