We've had a request from one of our users for the project name {name} on Read the Docs. You are the current owner, and we wanted to reach out to you in accordance with our Abandoned Project policy (http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abandoned-projects.html).
Since this is a fork of the existing owners project, {name}, you must show us the additional work that has been done in order to keep the new project name, that is different than the existing version of the project.
Please reply to this email either allowing or disallowing the transfer of the name on Read the Docs within 6 weeks, otherwise we will take the action of *initiating the transfer to a new owner* by default.
